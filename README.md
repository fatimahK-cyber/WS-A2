Hi, and Welcome to my Portfolio!

Description

This project is a web application developed as part of a university course, Web & Script Development (INFR3120U), to demonstrate core web development concepts, including templating, styling, and deployment. 
It serves as a portfolio-style site showcasing my work and applying concepts learned in the course.
